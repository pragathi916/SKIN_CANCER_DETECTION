# 🧠 Skin Cancer Detection using Pretrained Models & Ensemble Learning

This project detects skin cancer from input images using 6 pretrained deep learning models — ResNet, GoogleNet, EfficientNet, MobileNet, VGG, and ImageNet.  
Each model predicts the cancer type and outputs performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

Ensemble learning (hard and soft voting) is then applied to improve the final prediction.
